# Playmates


#### The Idea:

I noticed my friends liked keeping track of who they've dated in the past, or are currently dating. So I decided to build something that helps solve the problem. The goal is to get them to stop using google docs.

### NB:
This project is an ongoing one. Though the main features have been fleshed out, 
I believe it has market potential, hence I am going to keep building till I get users.

## Project Structure:

Repository 
  - env
  
  - Frontend
  
  - Django Project Directory
  - App Directory
  - manage.py
  - requirements.txt
    
#### To start backend api:
- ``` python manage.py runserver ```
#### To view project frontend:
- ``` cd frontend``` 
- ``` npm run serve ```
